# Customer_Segmentation

The purpose of this analysis is to perform clustering of customers using K-means clustering method. The [dataset](https://github.com/sowmyacr/kmeans_cluster/blob/master/CLV.csv) includes annual income and expenditure on the e-retail website for 303 customers.

Elbow method is used to find the number of clusters (k=6, in this case). One of the 6 clusters is then predicted for each customer, and visualization is done using a scatter plot.

The code, plots and analysis can be viewed in the 'customer_segmentation.ipynb' file in this repository.
